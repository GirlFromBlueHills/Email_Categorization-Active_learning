# Email_Categorization-Active_learning
Implemented Learning with Rationale Framework(http://www.cs.iit.edu/~ml/pdfs/sharma-naaclhlt15.pdf) Observed the performance of the classifier Multinomial Naive Bayes on subject of each email, which is  collected from my own two mailbox using  imaplib library to classify each email into three different labels, primary, social, promotion. Used learning with domain rationales and  active learning to improve learning efficiency in Email categorization . Compared the performance of the classifier with the Learning without Rationale with Learning with Rationale.  

Technology: Python 3.6, Scikit-learn 0.18.1.

Algorithm: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Active learning
